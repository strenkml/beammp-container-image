# Differences from original repo

The container does not depend on the environment variables. The server config is completely managed by the ServerConfig.toml file

    This project provides a container image for the <a href="https://beammp.com">BeamMP</a> 
    game server and shows its usage in a docker-compose environment.
</p>

## Motivation

Because there were no well-documented BeamMP server container images out there, I did one by myself.

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE and migration guide ⚠️

With the latest release of this container image there were two changes that will break your current setup:

1) The [environment variables](#environment-parameter) were renamed. 
2) The `ADDITIONAL_SERVER_CONFIG_TOML` no longer exists. Instead, you can now mount a custom `ServerConfig.toml` file
   to the container.

**In order to migrate you have to:**

1) Rename your existing environment variables to the new ones listed in the 
[environment variables](#environment-parameter) section. 
2) If you used the `ADDITIONAL_SERVER_CONFIG_TOML` environment variable, you have to create a `ServerConfig.toml` file
   and mount it to the container. See the [ServerConfig.toml](#custom-serverconfigtoml) section for more information.

## Usage

The sections below provides use cases for docker and docker-compose.

### docker

Quick start:

```bash
docker run --name beammp-server \
           -p 30814:30814/tcp -p 30814:30814/udp \
           -e BEAMMP_NAME='My first awesome Server' \
           -e BEAMMP_AUTH_KEY='<insert auth-key>' \
           rouhim/beammp-server
```

> If you want to interact with the server console, just add the `-it` flag to the docker run command.

### docker-compose

First clone this repository and check `docker-compose.yml` if interested. The configuration should be done within
the `.env` file.

To get started copy `.env.example` to `.env` and create the mod folder.

```bash
cp .env.example .env && mkdir client-mods server-mods
```

Adjust the values in the `.env` to your needs and run:

```bash
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d

```

### Server interaction

To connect to the interactive game server console, you need to start the server in detached (docker / -compose `-d`
flag) mode.
Then run the following command to attach to the server console:

```bash
docker attach <container-name>
```

## Environment parameter

| Variable name      | description                                                                                                   | default value                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|

| BEAMMP_DEBUG       | Set to true to enable debug output in the console.                                                            | false                        |
| BEAMMP_PRIVATE     | Set to true if you don't want to show up in the Server Browser.                                               | true                         |

| BEAMMP_MAX_PLAYERS | How many players your server can hold at a time.                                                              | 10                           |
| BEAMMP_MAP         | What the server map is.                                                                                       | /levels/gridmap_v2/info.json |
| BEAMMP_NAME        | What your server is called. This shows up in the Server Browser.                                              | BeamMP New Server            |
| BEAMMP_DESCRIPTION | What shows under the name when you click on the server.                                                       | BeamMP Default Description   |
| BEAMMP_PORT        | This value must be identical to the containers exposed port.                                                  | 30814                        |

A new **auth key** can be claimed on [this site](https://beammp.com/k/dashboard), you will need
a [Discord](https://discord.com) account for this. Note that the IP entered there does *not* matter, despite what the
site claims. For more information refer
to [this wiki page](https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/server-installation#h-2-obtaining-an-authentication-key).

## Client mods

In the first place you should consider
reading [the official mods guide](https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/server-installation#how-to-add-mods-to-your-server).
Mods can be downloaded from the [official BeamNG resources website](https://www.beamng.com/resources/). Just copy the
downloaded zip file into the `client-mods` folder.

### Custom maps

Copy the downloaded zip file into the `client-mods` folder.

Then have to find out the custom map path name (e.g.: `/levels/car_jump_arena/info.json`), to set it later as the map to
load. To do so:

1. Execute the shell command below, or open the zip file manually.
2. Copy the absolute path to the `info.json` location (`/levels/{map-name}/info.json`).
3. Set in .env file: `BEAMMP_MAP=/levels/{map-name}/info.json`. Example: `BEAMMP_MAP=/levels/car_jump_arena/info.json`

A simple way to print the full map path including info.json (_unzip_, _grep_ and _awk_ is required):

```shell
unzip -l PATH/TO/MAP.zip \
  | grep 'levels/.*/info.json' \
  | awk '{split($0,a," "); print "/"a[4]}'
```

## Server mods

Server mods can be found in the [BeamMP forum](https://forum.beammp.com/c/resource-plugin-area/server-resources).
Installation and configuration instructions are provided by each mod.

### Custom ServerConfig.toml

If you want to specify a custom `ServerConfig.toml` file, just create a new file called `ServerConfig.toml` and fill it
with your configuration. Make sure to mount the file as volume to the container. The file will be mounted to the server
directory on startup.

Docker example:

```bash
docker run --name beammp-server \
           -p 30814:30814/tcp -p 30814:30814/udp \
           -e BEAMMP_NAME='My first awesome Server' \
           -e BEAMMP_AUTH_KEY='<insert auth-key>' \
           -v ./ServerConfig.toml:/beammp/ServerConfig.toml \
           rouhim/beammp-server
```

For docker-compose, just add the following line to the `volumes` section:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./ServerConfig.toml:/beammp/ServerConfig.toml
```
